# Bacteria Colony Classification

Overview

Due to advancements in optics, extremely cheap microscopes with high magnification and resolution are available.
My personal favorite is foldscope-140X zoom and 2 micron resolution at less than 5 dollars.
Observing the microscopic world is easy, but recognizing what is being seen still requires expert knowledge.
So goal is to create an app which can recognize the organism being observed under the microscope and show information related to it. 
Can easily be used in interactive biology education, need to explore if it has other applications such as in auto-diagonostics.
