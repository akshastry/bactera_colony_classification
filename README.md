# Bacteria Colony Classification

Due to advancements in optics, extremely cheap microscopes with high magnification and resolution are available.
My personal favorite is foldscope-140X zoom and 2 micron resolution at manufacturing cost of less than a dollar. (Its personal deluxe kit is $50 though small educational kits in bulk are available for schools).
Observing the microscopic world is easy, but recognizing what is being seen still requires expert knowledge.
So goal is to create an app which can recognize the organism being observed under the microscope and show information related to it. 
This can easily be used in interactive biology education and if extended possibly in auto-diagonostics.
