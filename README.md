# Bacteria Colony Classification

Due to advancements in optics, extremely cheap microscopes with high magnification and resolution are available.My personal favorite is foldscope-140X zoom and 2 micron resolution at manufacturing cost of less than a dollar(Its personal deluxe kit is $50, though very cheap small educational kits in bulk are available for schools). Observing the microscopic world is easy, but recognizing what is being seen still requires expert knowledge. So, the goal of this project is to create an app which can recognize the organism being observed under the microscope and show information related to it. This can easily be used in interactive biology education and if extended possibly in auto-diagonostics.

## Pre-requisites

The code is written in Python and uses the following packages:

1. Keras
2. Tensorflow
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Scikit
6. PIL
7. Open CV
8. Glob
9. Matplotlib

## Dataset

The images can be downloaded from here: http://misztal.edu.pl/software/databases/dibas/

All the images should be extracted to a folder named 'Bacteria'. This folder the should be in the same folder as the code.
